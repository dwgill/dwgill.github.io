Summary: Some notes on documenting secret doors in Dungeons & Dragons
Status: draft

I started semi-regularly running games of Dungeons & Dragons recently,
and I've since been devouring all the advice on it I can read. I'm
particularly fond of the [Unearthed Arcana on the subject][ua-traps]
that Wizards of the Coast released a few months back, and appreciated
the structure suggested therein in articulating a trap: _Level and
Threat_, _Trigger_, and _Effect_. I've found this very useful in
guiding my thinking, and thought something similar might be appreciated
in describing secret doors.
